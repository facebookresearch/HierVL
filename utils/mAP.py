def calculate_mAP(sim_mat, relevancy_matrix):
    """
    Computes the mean average precision according to the following formula of
    average precision:
    \frac{\sum_{k=1}^n p(k) x rel(k)}{num_rel_docs}

    where p(k) is the precision at k, rel(k) is an indicator function
    determining whether the kth returned item is relevant or not and
    num_rel_docs is the number of relevant items to find within the search.

    The mean average precision is the mean of the average precision for each
    query item (i.e row in the matrix)

    This function takes in two parameters:
        - sim_mat: a NxM matrix which represents the similarity between two
        modalities (with modality 1 being of size N and modality 2 of size M).
        - relevancy_matrix: an NxM matrix which represents the relevancy between two
        modalities of items (with modality 1 being of size N and modality 2 of
        size M).
