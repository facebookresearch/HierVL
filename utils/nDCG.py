    Calculates the Discounted Cumulative Gain (DCG) between two modalities for
    the first modality.
    DCG = \sum_{i=1}^k \frac{rel_i}{log_2(i + 1)}
    i.e. the sum of the k relevant retrievals which is calculated as the scaled
    relevancy for the ith item. The scale is designed such that early
    retrievals are more important than later retrievals.
    Params:
        - similarity_matrix: matrix of size n1 x n2 where n1 is the number of
          items in the first modality and n2 is the number of items in the
          second modality. The [ith,jth] element is the predicted similarity
          between the ith item from the first modality and the jth item from
          the second modality.
        - relevancy_matrix: matrix of size n1 x n2 (see similarity_matrix
          above). The [ith, jth] element is the semantic relevancy between the
          ith item from the first modality and the jth item from the second
          modality.

    Works out the maximum number of allowed retrievals when working out the

          the second modality.
    Returns:
        - Matrix of size n1 x n2 (see relevancy matrix for more info). This is
          created as a mask such that if the [ith, jth] element is 1 it
          represents a valid item to use for the calculation of DCG for the
          ith item after sorting. For example, if relevancy matrix of:
        [[1, 0.5, 0],
          [0, 0  , 1]]
          is given, then the k_counts matrix will be:
        [[1, 1, 0],
         [1, 0, 0]]
         i.e. the first row has 2 non-zero items, so the first two retrieved
         items should be used in the calculation. In the second row there is
         only 1 relevant item, therefore only the first retrieved item should
         be used for the DCG calculation.
