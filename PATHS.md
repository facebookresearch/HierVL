## Path Helper

We have the following paths that must be filled in correctly before running the code

- `absolute/path/to/dataset/`: This path should contain the outputs generated by following the steps given in EgoVLP [codebase](https://github.com/showlab/EgoVLP).
- `/path/to/checkpoint.pth` contains the desired checkpoint path. Use the given links to download the appropriate checkpoints.
- `absolute/path/to/ego4d_chunked/` contains output path after running `utils/video_chunk.py`.
- `/path/to/slurm/log` is the desired SLURM output folder path.
- `/path/to/epic-kitchens-100-annotations/` refers to the location of EPIC-KITCHENS-100 annotations downloaded path.
- `/path/to/top/level/` is the location of the folder.
- `/path/to/experiments/` is the location where all the scripts are copied before submitting to SLURM.

Replacing all these paths with the appropriate link will help run the code.
